# AGENTS

## Startup
Read in this order:
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/architecture.md`
3. `docs/api-spec.md`
4. `docs/constraints.md`
5. `docs/observability.md`

Public API: yes.
This repo owns verify ingress and execution-fact writeback only.
If ownership, compatibility, or boundary questions appear, go back to `../devflow-control/docs/system/boundaries.md` and `../devflow-control/docs/policies/api-compatibility.md`.

## Commands
- `bash scripts/regen-swagger.sh`
- `go test ./...`
- `bash scripts/build.sh`

## API change completion
- Update `docs/api-spec.md` in the same change as the handler or transport change.
- Regenerate `docs/generated/swagger/*` with `bash scripts/regen-swagger.sh` before handoff.
- Sync `../devflow-control/docs/API_SURFACE.md` when the public contract or ownership summary changed.
- Review `../devflow-control/docs/policies/api-compatibility.md` before shipping any non-backward-compatible change.

## Before handoff
- Rerun `go test ./...`.
- Rerun `bash scripts/build.sh`.
- Ensure `docs/api-spec.md` and `docs/generated/swagger/*` are not stale.

## When to go back to devflow-control
Go back when the task changes verify ingress scope, writeback ownership, API compatibility expectations, or control-layer summaries.
