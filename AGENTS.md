Public API: yes.
This repo owns verify ingress and execution-fact writeback only.
If ownership, compatibility, or boundary questions appear, go back to `../devflow-control/docs/system/boundaries.md` and `../devflow-control/docs/policies/api-compatibility.md`.

## Commands
- `bash scripts/regen-swagger.sh`
- `go test ./...`
- `bash scripts/build.sh`

## When to go back to devflow-control
Go back when the task changes verify ingress scope, writeback ownership, API compatibility expectations, or control-layer summaries.
